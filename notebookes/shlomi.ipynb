    "The first 30 days are used for calculating the features (predictors), for each crime in the last day.\n",

    "In other words, for each crime that happend in the last day, the location points are extracted (rows). For each one of these points (location + crime type), the features are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the occurrence of crime type T, we first defined a one-month training window (January 1, 2013 – January 31, 2013). We then put down labeled points (latitude/longitude pairs) across the city limits of Chicago. These points came from two sources: (1) from the locations of known crimes of type T within the training window (these points received a label T), and (2) from a grid of evenly spaced points at 200-meter intervals, not coinciding with points from the first set (these points received a label NONE).\n",

    "The set of prediction points included those obtained by evenly spacing points at 200-meter intervals across the prediction area. We also added to the set of prediction points all points where crimes of type T occurred during the training window. We added these points to force higher-resolution predictions in areas where we had observed more crime in the past. In any case, a prediction point was simply a latitude-longitude pair containing no ground-truth information about future crime.\n",

Better prediction performance is indicated by curves that approach the upper-left corner of the plot area or, equivalently, by curves with higher AUC scores.

This property makes surveillance plots appropriate for decision makers, who must allocate scarce resources (e.g., police patrols) across the geographic space. Lastly, because each model execution produced a series of surveillance plots for crime type T , one for each prediction day, we aggre- gated the plots to measure a model’s overall performance. For example, to compute a model’s aggregate y-value for crime type T at an x-value of 5%, we first summed the number of true T crimes occurring in the top 5% most threatened area for each prediction day. We then divided that sum by the\n",
